# shortestPaths
calculating and showing shortest path(s) between two vertices 

it was created as fun side project to help me find shortest path to drive to my job, I cropped a fragment of map between me and work, junctions became vertices and roads between them became edges, said algorithm helped me find shortet path to ride.
